        <h1>Mathematics</h1>
        <p>
          mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that has
          evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing
          the shapes of objects. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative
          calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of
          idealization and abstraction of its subject matter. Since the 17th
          century, mathematics has been an indispensable adjunct to the physical
          sciences and technology, and in more recent times it has assumed a
          similar role in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences.
